# Embedding Forge - Statement of Work

## Current Project Status

The project currently has a basic foundation with:
- Express.js server with REST API endpoints
- SQLite database with tables for models, topics, and phrases
- Basic UI for managing models, topics, and phrases
- Initial embedding generation functionality

## Project Vision

Embedding Forge will be a comprehensive tool that allows users to:
1. Define semantic topics through representative phrases
2. Generate and manage topic embeddings
3. Export and use these embeddings in other applications
4. Validate and refine topics through interactive testing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Enhancement
- [ ] Database Schema Updates
  - [ ] Add weights table for phrase-topic relationships
  - [ ] Add embedding_cache table for storing generated embeddings
  - [ ] Add metadata table for storing model configurations
  - [ ] Add version control table for topic definitions

- [ ] API Enhancement
  - [ ] Add endpoints for weighted phrase management
  - [ ] Add endpoints for embedding generation and caching
  - [ ] Add endpoints for topic validation
  - [ ] Add endpoints for embedding export

- [ ] Authentication & Authorization
  - [ ] Implement user authentication system
  - [ ] Add role-based access control

### Phase 2: Embedding Engine Development
- [ ] Core Embedding Functions
  - [ ] Implement weighted average embedding calculation
  - [ ] Add support for multiple embedding models
  - [ ] Implement embedding caching system
  - [ ] Add batch processing for large phrase sets

- [ ] Validation System
  - [ ] Implement cross-validation with test phrases
  - [ ] Add similarity threshold configuration
  - [ ] Implement conflict detection between topics
  - [ ] Add phrase suggestion system

- [ ] Export System
  - [ ] Implement multiple export formats (JSON, binary, base64)
  - [ ] Add model metadata to exports
  - [ ] Generate sample code for JavaScript
  - [ ] Add versioning for exported embeddings

### Phase 3: UI Development
- [ ] Topic Management Interface
  - [ ] Add weighted phrase management UI
  - [ ] Add visual weight adjustment controls
  - [ ] Implement topic version control UI

- [ ] Validation Interface
  - [ ] Add real-time similarity testing
  - [ ] Implement visualization of phrase relationships
  - [ ] Add topic comparison view
  - [ ] Create phrase suggestion interface

- [ ] Export Interface
  - [ ] Add export format configuration
  - [ ] Implement export preview
  - [ ] Add sample code viewer
  - [ ] Create export history view

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Technical Documentation
  - [ ] Database schema documentation
  - [ ] Embedding model compatibility guide
  - [ ] Development setup guide

- [ ] User Documentation
  - [ ] User guide
  - [ ] Best practices guide

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for core functions

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Node.js with Express (vanilla JavaScript)
- SQLite for data storage
- Hugging Face Transformers for embeddings

### Frontend
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (vanilla JavaScript)
- Modern CSS (no need for a framework)
- Interactive visualization library (to be selected)
